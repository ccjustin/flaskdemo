hi all, this is justin

link to lab slides:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nAlJP9Ut2O8DkE2HJ06zx6BK7cOHi7_7IcwTB-IxVJ4/edit#slide=id.p23

first, create your own branch. name it your uniqname. you can refer to the git tutorial i wrote in the slides back at the start of the semester. after you've created it, switch into it.

please follow instructions starting on slide 23 for setup!
this will set up your python virtual environment.
to exit out of an environment, just enter "deactivate" into the terminal.

run "python3 serverside_demo.py" to start up the script. you'll see that the terminal returns output similar to this:
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
 * Running on http://192.168.1.178:8000

copy either of the last two addresses in the output into your browser.
from here, you can hit any of the routes defined in "serverside_demo.py". 
for example, you can visit:

http://192.168.1.178:8000/u/ccjustin/

to see the HTML returned by that route. observe the terminal's output after you hit this route.

task : 
1. create your own route in serverside_demo.py that returns HTML containing some things about you.
- uniqname
- where you're from
- talk about something you like to do :D have fun with it

2. check out sessions_demo.py
run it with "python3 sessions_demo.py", and try to understand how the routes are communicating with 
each other in this file. note that a couple of them only receive POST requests!
